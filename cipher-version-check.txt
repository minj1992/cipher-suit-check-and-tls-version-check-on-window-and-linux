In Linux, checking the enabled or disabled status of a specific cipher suite typically involves inspecting the configuration of the application or service that uses OpenSSL, rather than using a command to directly query the status.

For example, if you're interested in checking the status of a cipher suite for a web server like Apache or Nginx, you would typically look at the server's SSL/TLS configuration file (httpd.conf for Apache, or nginx.conf for Nginx) or the SSL/TLS virtual host configuration files.

In these configuration files, cipher suites can be explicitly enabled or disabled using directives like SSLCipherSuite (for Apache) or ssl_ciphers (for Nginx).

Here's a general approach to check the status of a cipher suite:

Locate the SSL/TLS configuration file for your application or service.
Look for the directive responsible for configuring cipher suites.
Check if the specific cipher suite you're interested in is listed and whether it's explicitly enabled or disabled.
You can then modify the configuration file as needed to enable or disable cipher suites according to your requirements. After making changes, you'll typically need to restart or reload the application or service for the changes to take effect.
